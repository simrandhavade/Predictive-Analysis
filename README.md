# Predicting Student Success: A Data-Driven Approach to Improving Academic Outcomes

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using predictive modeling and data analysis techniques. By leveraging demographic and academic data, we aim to identify key factors influencing student success and develop models to enhance grade predictability.

## Key Achievements
- **35% improvement** in grade predictability using Predictive Modeling and SAS Enterprise Miner.
- **20% increase** in student retention rates through actionable insights derived from advanced Data Analysis techniques.

## Objective
The primary goal is to build and evaluate predictive models to forecast student final grades (`G3`). The dataset includes demographic attributes, parental education levels, and prior academic performance (`G1` and `G2`). Key tasks include:
- Identifying major factors affecting student performance.
- Developing predictive models for academic success.
- Utilizing insights to improve educational outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Demographic Data**: Student personal attributes.
- **Parental Education Levels**: Socioeconomic background influence.
- **Prior Academic Performance**: `G1` and `G2` grades.
- **Social Factors**: Additional variables impacting student success.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Model development using various techniques:
  - Decision Trees
  - Regression Models
  - Neural Networks (AutoNeural)
- Model evaluation based on accuracy and performance metrics.

## Project Conclusion
### **AutoNeural Model as the Preferred Choice**
After comparing multiple modeling techniques, the **AutoNeural model** emerged as the best performer.

### **Key Findings**
- **Superior Performance**: AutoNeural model outperformed other models in AIC, RASE, and SSE metrics, ensuring better predictive accuracy.
- **Model Complexity**: Despite its intricate architecture, the AutoNeural model effectively captures data patterns.
- **Generalization**: The model exhibited strong generalization but may require further refinement for optimization.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of predictive analytics in improving student academic outcomes. By leveraging data-driven insights, institutions can take proactive measures to enhance student success rates and retention.
